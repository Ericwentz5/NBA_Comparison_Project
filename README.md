Our application bridges the gap between complex NBA statistics and everyday basketball enthusiasts by providing an intuitive platform that identifies the professional players most similar to local pickup players. We simplify detailed NBA data into 5 key statistics—scoring, shooting, defending, passing, rebounding—by consolidating related metrics. Each NBA player is rated on a scale of 1-100 for these key stats, reflecting their percentile rankings within the league.
Users can input their own basketball attributes using interactive sliders corresponding to these key statistics, calibrated to their playing environment (example: how good your shooting is relative to people in your intramural league). The application then calculates the Euclidean distance between the user's inputs and the profiles of NBA players to determine the top three closest matches. Visualizations, such as spider plots for each player's stats, provide an engaging and accessible way for fans of the game to compare themselves with their favorite professional athletes.
